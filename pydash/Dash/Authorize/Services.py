# client_id
#     Required. The client ID provided to you by Spotify when you register your application.
# response_type
#     Required. Set it to code.
# redirect_uri
#     Required. The URI to redirect to after the user grants/denies permission. This URI needs to have been
#     entered in the Redirect URI whitelist that you specified when you registered your application. The value
#     of redirect_uri here must exactly match one of the values you entered when you registered your application,
#     including upper/lowercase, terminating slashes, etc.
# state
#     Optional, but strongly recommended. The state can be useful for correlating requests and responses.
#     Because your redirect_uri can be guessed, using a state value can increase your assurance that an
#     incoming connection is the result of an authentication request. If you generate a random string or
#     encode the hash of some client state (e.g., a cookie) in this state variable, you can validate the
#     response to additionally ensure that the request and response originated in the same browser. This
#     provides protection against attacks such as cross-site request forgery. See RFC-6749.
# scope
#     Optional. A space-separated list of scopes: see Using Scopes. If no scopes are specified, authorization will be granted only
#     to access publicly available information: that is, only information normally visible in the Spotify desktop, web and mobile players.
